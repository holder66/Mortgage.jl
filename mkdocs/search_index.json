Default: principal=100000\n\n\nrate::Number\n: annual interest rate, in percent, eg 3.26 . Default: rate=10.0\n\n\namortization::Number\n: the number of years over which the entire loan or mortgage would be paid off. Default is amortization=25\n\n\nfrequency::String\n: \"m\" for monthly (default); \"w\" for weekly; \"t\" for two weeks; \"b\" for bimonthly. Note that for bimonthly payments, they will occur on the first and the fifteenth of each month, and the mortgage should start on the first or fifteenth of the month.\n\n\ncompounding::String\n: \"s\" for none (simple interest; note that interest accrues daily but is not compounded); \"m\" for monthly (ie American) (this is the default); \"c\" for Canadian (ie semi-annual. Note that variable rate mortgages often compound monthly - check the fine print.)\n\n\nstartdate::Date\n: start date for the mortgage; default is today's date. Enter as: startdate=Date(2016,7,13)\n\n\nterm::String\n: specify the term in years; use \"1/4\" for 3 months and \"1/2\" for 6 months; enter \"a\" to indicate for the entire amortization interval (ie until paid off); default is 5 years. A term greater than the amortization will generate an error.\n\n\npayment::Number\n: payment amount; if not specified, it will be calculated based on the amortization interval. Note that for simple interest mortgages, the payment will be calculated as for monthly compounded mortgages.\n\n\n\n\ntable\n\n\nThis value returned by mortgage() is a one-dimensional array with eight values for each payment. The values are:    paymentNumber, paymentDate, principalAmount, interestAmount, accumulatedPrincipal, accumulatedInterest, accumulatedTotal, balance.

Arguments   principal::Number : the principal amount of the loan or mortgage, in any decimal-based currency. Default: principal=100000  rate::Number : annual interest rate, in percent, eg 3.26 . Default: rate=10.0  amortization::Number : the number of years over which the entire loan or mortgage would be paid off. Default is amortization=25  frequency::String : \"m\" for monthly (default); \"w\" for weekly; \"t\" for two weeks; \"b\" for bimonthly. Note that for bimonthly payments, they will occur on the first and the fifteenth of each month, and the mortgage should start on the first or fifteenth of the month.  compounding::String : \"s\" for none (simple interest; note that interest accrues daily but is not compounded); \"m\" for monthly (ie American) (this is the default); \"c\" for Canadian (ie semi-annual. Note that variable rate mortgages often compound monthly - check the fine print.)  startdate::Date : start date for the mortgage; default is today's date. Enter as: startdate=Date(2016,7,13)  term::String : specify the term in years; use \"1/4\" for 3 months and \"1/2\" for 6 months; enter \"a\" to indicate for the entire amortization interval (ie until paid off); default is 5 years. A term greater than the amortization will generate an error.  payment::Number : payment amount; if not specified, it will be calculated based on the amortization interval. Note that for simple interest mortgages, the payment will be calculated as for monthly compounded mortgages.   table  This value returned by mortgage() is a one-dimensional array with eight values for each payment.
