Compounding   takes   the   values   m ,   for   monthly   ( American )   compounding ;  c ,   for   Canadian   ( biannual )   compounding ;   or   s ,   for   simple   interest   ( no   compounding ) .  Payment   frequency   takes   values   m   for   monthly ;  b   for   bimonthly   ( twice   a   month ,   on   the   first   and   the   fifteenth );  w   for   weekly ;   and   t   for   every   two   weeks .

To   write   the   listing   to   a   text   file ,   provide   the   file   name ,   eg   output = fileName.txt .
